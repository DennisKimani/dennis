  <p>I was always fascinated about web applications that had cool styling and some animated features. I decided to join into the programming world for a quest to know how to build web applications. After completion of my high school studies I shared my thoughts with my sister who did some research about some of the universities which offer programming courses. I wasnâ€™t comfortable about the idea of going to the university to learn for four years, which to me was rather a long time to learn something. One of my sisters friends attended a tech where she heard about this school called Moringa school. I sorted to research about the school and it was all I needed, it offered a 6 months intensive coding course for one to be a world class web developer. There was a recruitment which was happening for the next class which was joining and I applied for the chance to join the school. There I built my first web applications using HTML during the first week and progressed further by learning javascript and ruby. I gained non-technical skills like working in groups and communication skills.</p>
